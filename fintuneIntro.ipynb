      "1. Choose a quiet and distraction-free area: Find a quiet area with minimal distractions where your dog can focus on you.\n",
      "2. Have treats ready: Choose your dog's favorite treats and have them ready to use as rewards.\n",
      "3. Stand in front of your dog: Stand in front of your dog and hold a treat close to their nose.\n",
      "4. Move the treat up and back: Slowly move the treat up and back, towards your dog's tail, while saying \"sit\" in a calm and clear voice.\n",
      "5. Dog will sit: As you move the treat, your dog will naturally sit down to follow the treat. The moment their bottom touches the ground, say \"good sit\" and give them the treat.\n",
      "6. Repeat the process: Repeat steps 3-5 several times, so your dog learns to associate the command \"sit\" with the action of sitting.\n",
      "7. Gradually phase out the treats: As your dog becomes more comfortable with the command, start phasing out the treats. Instead, use praise and affection as rewards.\n",
      "8. Practice, practice, practice: Practice the \"sit\" command in different locations, with different distractions, and at different times of the day. This will help your dog understand that the command is universal and applies in all situations.\n",
      "9. Be consistent: Consistency is key when training a dog. Make sure everyone in the household is using the same command and reward system.\n",
      "10. Be patient: Training a dog takes time and patience. Don't get frustrated if your dog doesn't pick up the command immediately. Keep practicing and eventually, your dog will learn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, training a dog is a journey, and it's important to be patient, consistent, and positive. With time and practice, your dog will learn to sit on command and other basic obedience commands.\n"

Repeat this several times until your dog understands that the command \"stay\" means to remain in the sitting position.\n",

I\\'ve done this several times going from larger HDD to smaller SSD and I wound up with a bootable SSD drive. One step you have to remember not to skip is to use Disk Utility to partition the SSD as GUID partition scheme HFS+ before doing the clone. If it came Apple Partition Scheme, even if you let CCC do the clone, the resulting drive won\\'t be bootable. CCC usually works in \"file mode\" and it can easily copy a larger drive (that\\'s mostly empty) onto a smaller drive. If you tell CCC to clone a drive you did NOT boot from, it can work in block copy mode where the destination drive must be the same size or larger than the drive you are cloning from (if I recall).\\nI\\'ve actually done this somehow on Disk Utility several times (booting from a different drive (or even the dvd) so not running disk utility from the drive your cloning) and had it work just fine from larger to smaller bootable clone. Definitely format the drive cloning to first, as bootable Apple etc..\\nThanks for pointing this out.
